2) Open the folder in Microsoft Visual Studio (or other compiler) > Go to the code file > Run the Code

After Running the Code, Close the Graph to Move to Next Graph
Allow Computation Time after Closing Each Graph for Next Graph to Open (1-15 Seconds for Each)
There are a total of 18 Graphs (Each Graph needs to be closed for the next Graph to be Displayed)
Make sure data.csv is in same folder as the code. If it still shows error reading the data, enter full path in the line where the csv file is imported.
